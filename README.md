# logistics-Big-Data-Project

## 🚀 Project Vision & Objective
In today’s highly competitive e-commerce landscape, operational efficiency and customer satisfaction are key drivers of success. This project aims to **build a scalable, data-driven analytics platform** that transforms raw logistics and sales data into actionable business intelligence.

By leveraging Big Data tools like **Sqoop**, **Apache Spark**, and **Hive**, the platform enables insights into **delivery performance, financial efficiency, and product-level bottlenecks**, ultimately supporting strategic decision-making.

## 🧩 Business Problems Addressed

🔴 **Unpredictable Deliveries**
Inconsistent delivery times lead to poor customer experience and reduced satisfaction.

🔴 **Rising Operational Costs**
Unclear relationship between shipping costs and product-level revenue affects profitability.

🔴 **Warehouse Inefficiency**
Lack of visibility into underperforming warehouses makes optimization difficult.

🔴 **Limited Product Insight**
No clear view of which products are frequently delayed, impacting inventory and supplier decisions.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Apache Sqoop** – for ingesting data from relational databases into HDFS

**Apache Spark** – for distributed data processing and analytics

**Apache Hive** – for querying and reporting structured data

**HDFS** – for data storage

ETL Pipeline:
Data from transactional systems is ingested using **Sqoop**, transformed and processed with **Spark**, and stored in **Hive tables** to support analytical queries and dashboards.

## 📈 Resulting Business Insights 

✅ Reduced Operational Costs
✅ Improved Customer Satisfaction
✅ Enhanced Operational Efficiency through better warehouse and inventory decisions
